This is the source code used in 'Revisiting Immediate Duplicate Detection in
External Memroy Search' by Shunji Lin, Alex Fukunaga, accepted for the 32nd
AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18).

This source code is built upon the 15 Puzzle solver by Ethan Burns, as used in
``Implementing Fast Heuristic Search Code,'' by Burns, Hatem, Leighton, and
Ruml, in Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Search
(SoCS-12), 2012.

The src/ directory contains the most optimized versions of both
IDA* and A* (Burns et al. 2012), as well as the external search algorithms,
A*-IDD, A*-DDD and External A*

        Most optimized version of A* (Burns et al. 2012), implementation by Ethan
        Burns

src/idastar.hpp
